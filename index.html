						<h1>Blockchain</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, 
							we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored 
							in a public database (the “chain”).

						<aside class="notes">
							“Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of pieces of information. 
							Especially, they have three parts.
							1.Information about transactions/
							2.Information about who is taking part in transactions/
							3.Information that distinguishes them from other blocks/

						<img data-src="src/Hash_function.svg" width="800px">
						<aside class="notes">
							Hash codes are created by a math function
							that turns digital information into 
							a string of numbers and letters.

						<h1>How does it work?</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ol>
							<li>A transaction must occur.</li>
							<li>That transaction must be verified.</li>
							<li>That transaction must be stored in a block.</li>
							<li>That block must be given a hash.</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
							In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, however, 
							4 things must happen.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<img data-src="src/blockchain_to_calculate_2.png" height="250px">
						<aside class="notes">
							The block is also given the hash of the most recent block added to the blockchain. 
							Once hashed, the block can be added to the blockchain.

						<h1>Where Is the Blockchain Stored?</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							Anyone can view the contents of the blockchain, 
							but users can also opt to connect their computers to the blockchain network.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="src/blockchainnet.png" height="600px">
						<aside class="notes"> 
							Their computer receives a copy of the blockchain 
							that is updated automatically whenever a new block is added. 
							As each copy of the blockchain is identical, spreading 
							that information across a network of computers 
							makes the information more difficult to manipulate.

					<section>
						<h1>Blockchain Security</h1>
						<aside class="notes"> 
							Transactions on blockchain are not completely anonymous, 
							personal information about users is limited to their digital signature.
							If you cannot know who is adding 
							blocks to the blockchain, how can you trust blockchain? 
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="src/blockchain-how-it-works.jpg" height="600px">
						<aside class="notes"> 
							After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, 
							it is very difficult to go back and change the contents of the block. 
							That’s because each block contains its own hash, along with the hash 
							of the block before it.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="src/Consensus_flow_chart.svg" height="600px">
						<aside class="notes"> 
							To address the issue of trust, blockchain networks have implemented tests for computers 
							that want to join and add blocks to the chain. 
							The tests, called “consensus models,” require users to “prove” themselves
 							before they can participate in a blockchain network.
