						<h1>Blockchain Security</h1>

					<section>
						<img data-src="src/blockchain-how-it-works.jpg" height="600px">
						<aside class="notes"> 
							After a block has been added to the end of the blockchain, 
							it is very difficult to go back and change the contents of the block. 
							That’s because each block contains its own hash, along with the hash 
							of the block before it.
							If the main information is edited in any way, the hash code changes as well.

					<section>
						<img data-src="src/Consensus_flow_chart.svg" height="600px">
						<aside class="notes"> 
							Once a block is added to the blockchain it becomes very difficult to edit and impossible to delete.
							To address the issue of trust, blockchain networks have implemented tests for computers 
							that want to join and add blocks to the chain. 
							The tests, called “consensus models,” require users to “prove” themselves
 							before they can participate in a blockchain network.
